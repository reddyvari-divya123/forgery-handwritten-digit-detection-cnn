# forgery-handwritten-digit-detection-cnn
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect forged handwritten numerals. It processes image data, trains on handwritten samples, and classifies them as genuine or forged. Built using Python and TensorFlow, it helps automate forgery detection in documents.
