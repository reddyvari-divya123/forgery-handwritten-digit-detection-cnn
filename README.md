# Forgery Detection in Handwritten Digits using CNN
This project aims to detect forged handwritten digits using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It focuses on automating the identification of fake or altered numerals in documents, which can be useful in sectors like banking, education, and administration.
## Objective
The main goal of this project is to build a deep learning model that can classify handwritten digits as either *genuine* or *forged*. By using CNNs, the model learns to recognize subtle differences in handwriting patterns, pressure, and shape that may indicate forgery.
## Problem Statement
Forgery in handwritten documents is a serious issue, especially in contexts like:
- Altered bank cheques
- Fake academic mark sheets
- Tampered ID numbers on forms
Manually verifying these can be time-consuming and error-prone. This project offers an automated solution using image classification.
## My Role
- Designed the concept and project architecture
- Researched and selected suitable techniques (CNNs) for image-based forgery detection
- Created sample data and designed the logic for classification
- Documented the process thoroughly
## Tools & Technologies
- *Python* – Primary programming language
- *TensorFlow / Keras* – For building and training the CNN
- *Jupyter Notebook* – For experimenting and visualization
- *NumPy, Matplotlib* – For data manipulation and plotting
- *OpenCV* – For image preprocessing (planned)
## How It Works (Conceptually)
1. *Data Collection*: Images of handwritten digits are collected. These include both real and intentionally forged examples.
2. *Preprocessing*: Images are converted to grayscale, resized, and normalized.
3. *Model Training*: A CNN model is trained on labeled data (genuine vs. forged).
4. *Evaluation*: The model is tested to check accuracy, precision, and recall.
5. *Prediction*: Given a new image, the model predicts whether it is forged or not.
## Project Impact
- *Automation*: Reduces manual work in document verification
- *Accuracy*: CNNs can detect subtle variations better than traditional methods
- *Scalability*: The concept can be extended to full document forgery detection
## Future Scope
- Integrate with a web interface using Flask or Streamlit
- Extend to full-document forgery detection (not just digits)
- Train on larger and more diverse datasets
- Add explainability tools like Grad-CAM to show how the model makes decisions
## About Me
I am passionate about applying deep learning techniques to solve real-world problems. This project reflects my ability to understand a problem deeply, design a solution, and communicate it effectively — even in the absence of complete code or deployment.
